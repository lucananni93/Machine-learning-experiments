# Machine Learning experiments
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with explanations and implementation of some Machine Learning, Statistics and Data Analysis methods. Each argument is firstly described and theoretically explained and then implemented *without* using any external library.

> Concepts are more important than efficiency.

## Classical Machine Learning
* [Naive Bayes](./notebooks/Naive_Bayes.ipynb )
* [Polynomial Curve fitting](./Polynomial_Curve_Fitting.ipynb): evaluation of models of several degree
* [Linear Regression](./Linear_Regression.ipynb): both frequentist and bayesian approach
* [Linear Classification](./Linear_Classification.ipynb): least squares
* [Principal Component Analysis](./Principal_Component_Analysis.ipynb)
* [Monte Carlo Method](./Monte_Carlo_Method.ipynb)
* [Markov Chains](./Markov_Chains.ipynb)
