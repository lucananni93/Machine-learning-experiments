# Machine Learning experiments
In this repository you will find some very simple implementations of classical machine learning algorithms.
The solutions mainly use the *numpy* mathematical library and are usually delivered in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Implemented algorithms
* [Naive Bayes](./Naive_Bayes.ipynb )
* [Polynomial Curve fitting](./Polynomial_Curve_Fitting.ipynb): evaluation of models of several degree
* [Linear Regression](./Linear_Regression.ipynb): both frequentist and bayesian approach
* [Linear Classification](./Linear_Classification.ipynb): least squares
