    "Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called **factors**. [...] The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus \"error\" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables.
